1/30/2016 version 0x14
Fixed a bug in checking event number in header and trailer
module daq_link_7s.vhd modified
module TTS_TRIG_if.vhd modified
12/22/2015 version 0x13
Added logic to protect against illeagal input data
from collapsing the system
module daq_link_7s.vhd modified
11/12/2015 version 0x12
Output port Ready is now permanently connected to '1'(Always ready)
When InitLink received, the signal is extended until all data in AMC are
emptied, which is important if AMC got more data than expected when ReSync
is received.
module DAQ_link_7s.vhd modified
8/18/2015 version 0x11
Added input signal ReSyncAndEmpty for
proper ReSync operation
After receiving a ReSync TTC command, an AMC module can either continue 
to send the data in its buffer until the buffer is empty, or simply clear the
buffer. Once its buffer is empty, the AMC module should assert the ReSyncAndEmpty
signal high for at least 10ns and when it is ready to receive L1A, set TTS to ready.
(According to ReSync spec, AMC should set its TTS to busy after receiving the ReSync)
AMC13 will forward AMC data to the DAQ and fill with fake event data if necessary.

3/29/2015 version 0xb
This new version fixed a bug in TTS_TRIG_if.vhd which can cause amc13 to
amc connection difficulties.
The generic parameter USE_TRIGGER_PORT has been moved to an input port.
There are three other new ports at the end of the port list.
During instantiation, connect '0' to port sysclk and assign open to ports
L1A_DATA_we and L1A_DATA. These ports are used in other designs and now
they can share the same code.

In module's declaration or its instantiation, set the
generic parameter F_REFCLK as your design's frequency of the GTX reference
clock

If you are using amc13 firmware 0x4xxx, input port USE_TRIGGER_PORT
should be set to boolean value TRUE in your instantiation, otherwise
set it to FALSE

please include the following line in your xst file:

create_clock -period 4.000 -name DAQ_usrclk [get_pins */i_DAQ_Link_7s/i_UsrClk/o]

where i_DAQ_Link_7s is the instance name of the module DAQ_Link_7s
in its upper level module.
