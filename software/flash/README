This directory contains software tools for accessing the Flash of the FC7.

The FC7 used IPbus for Ethernet communication:
   svnweb.cern.ch/trac/cactus/wiki

To build all the code:
   1. source setenv.sh
   2. run "make" in the base directory

The result of the "make" command should be:
   1. "obj" directory containing object (.o) and dependency (.d) files for each C++ file
   2. "lib" directory containing the shared library (.so) file for the FlashTool class
   3. "bin" directory containing executables

The current executables are only for updating the firmware stored in the Flash. The encoder/
fanout bitstream is stored at address 0x00000000 in the Flash. These addresses are hardcoded
in the firmware and in the C++ code.

Usage:

    programFirmware [crate numbers] [slot numbers] [mcs file]
    eraseFirmware   [crate numbers] [slot numbers]
