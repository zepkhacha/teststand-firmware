Muon g-2 Experiment (E989) Clock and Controls Center (CCC) FC7 FPGA Software
============================================================================

This repository contains the configuration tools for the FC7 FPGA used in the
Clock and Controls Center (CCC) in the Muon g-2 Experiment (E989) for the Muon
g-2 experiment (E989) at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.


Software Requirements
---------------------

The CCC setup and configuration is handled through a set of Python tools. This
software depends on IPbus being already setup. The required IPbus software is
stored in the 'gm2ipbus' repository on Redmine. Before using the CCC tools, make
sure that IPbus is installed and setup properly in the terminal environment.


Software Developers
-------------------

The software, specific to E989, was written by David A. Sweigart.  Feel free to
contact him with any comments and/or questions at das556@cornell.edu.
